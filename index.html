Initially, in 1947, nearly all the territory is marked as Palestinian (green), with sparse Jewish settlements (white). The UN Partition Plan of 1947 proposes a division, introducing significant white areas for a future Israeli state. By 1949–1967, Israeli territory expands sharply, reducing Palestinian land to fragmented zones. In the 2005 map, Palestinian areas appear as isolated patches, highlighting the extent of territorial loss and fragmentation over time due to occupation and settlement expansion.`

Islam first arrived in the region in the 7th century during the Rashidun Caliphate, when Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattāb peacefully entered Jerusalem, marking the beginning of Islamic rule. Since then, Islamic traditions, architecture, and values have shaped daily life, with sacred sites like Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem standing as powerful symbols of faith and resilience.`

The most recent war in October 2023 saw unprecedented destruction, with thousands of casualties and widespread displacement.
